import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory. The pipeline outputs results in a BIDS-like structure (BIDS derivatives are not officially described and accepted in the BIDS specification, so don't hesitate to open an issue if something should be changed). As such, your root output folder will contain one folder per subject.

<FileTree>
  * sf-tractomics-v0.1.0/
    * multiqc/
    * sub-0001/
      * anat/
      * dwi/
      * stats/
      * report/
    * sub-0002/

</FileTree>

The pipeline will output only the final preprocessed files by default. This behavior is used to limit the number of files generated by the pipeline by omitting the publishing of intermediate results. It is particularly useful when running the pipeline on clusters where file quotas are often rapidly met. To opt-out from the lean output version (**not recommended**), set the [`--lean_output`](/sf-tractomics/0.1.0/guides/parameters#generic-options) parameter to false when launching the pipeline (e.g., `--lean_output false`).

### **Pipeline overview**

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and data processing steps can be grouped. The final output files are listed below for each of those steps. If you used `--lean_output false`, you will find additional files than the ones described here (**not recommended**, this will highly increase the number of output files).

:::note[Sidecar JSON files]
In addition to the output files described below, you will also find **sidecar JSON file** for nifti volumes. Those will contain informations regarding their source (either raw or processed), the applied transforms, and/or processing steps.

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates HTML reports on the subject-level and reports on population-level statistics. In your output folder, you will find a global MultiQC report (located next to your `sub-XXXX` folders). This is the population level report, containing statistics allowing the evaluation of outliers in terms of white matter coverage, number of streamlines, and volume, thickness, and surface area for each regions of the GM parcellation.

Within each subject folder, you will find subject-specific HTML reports. Those will display visual QC of some of the key processing steps performed during the pipeline execution. Those figures (for now) comprise: sphere sampling, tissue segmentation, white matter coverage, labels overlay on anatomical image, and metrics maps visualization. You can refer to those subject-specific reports to obtain a quick overview of the quality of the processing.

### **Stats**

  * `pipeline_info/`
    * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
    * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
    * Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
